# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React pathfinding visualizer that implements Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search. Also implements Prim's recursive division algorithm to generate mazes.

I made this project to work on my proficiency with React, while also putting some of my data structures and algorithms knowledge to pracitcal use. I had a ton of fun making it, and I hope it can help others see the awesomeness of pathfinding algorithms!
